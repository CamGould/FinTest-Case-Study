## Overview and Origin of VersaBank 
*VersaBank* is a Canadian-founded Scheduale 1 chartered bank with a main focus on being a 'branchless' commercial bank which incorperates new and emerging finacial technologies. *VersaBank* describes themselves as 'the bank of the future' where customers experience efficiency, reduced costs, and increased choice through thier virtual banking experience. During the early 1990s, David Tyler the founder and current president of *VersaBank* began bringing his 'branchless banking' idea to life when he purchased *Pacific & Western Trust* in 1993.  *Pacific & Western Trust* was a previously established bank that was founded on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1979 in Saskatoon, SK and was granted licence to operate later that year on October 12<sup>th</sup>, 1979. During this time in the early 1990s, Tyler recognized the potenial emerging trends and technologies that could address needs previously unmet in the Canadian finacial sector. During 2002, with the incorperation of a well-established Scheduale 1 bank, VersaBank was 1 of only 9 Canadian banks with a Scheduale 1 Bank licence. From here on, *VersaBank* narrowed its focus on becoming an innovative ‘branchless finacial institution’ which could focus on meeting the needs of previouly ignored or misunderstood niche markets with remote inexpesive yet powerful solutions. Tyler explains on *VersaBank’s* website his intial idea for the company, which focused on two core aspects of banking, the deposit buisness and the lending buisness. Over the years, *VersaBank’s* deposit buisness has seen tremendous growth and has become the most used solution in the Canadian market. *VersaBank’s* lending buisness has also seen much growth with a focus on developing affordable capital access for both point-of-sale loans and lease partners. Over the last few years the company has expanded its vision into a new area to yet again solve customer needs, this time in the digital assets industry. With the recent launch of *VersaVault*, customers can now easily and securly access storage of their digital assets in a digital equivalient of a safety deposit box. In late 2021, *VersaBank* became a publicly-traded company trading under the ticker [NASDAQ:VBNK](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vbnk/real-time). The IPO raised CA $66 M when it opened with IPO share prices of CA $12.00 on September 24<sup>th</sup>,2021.  

## Buisness Acitivities 
As a remote Canadian Bank, *VersaBank* strives to provide increased efficency and choice to Canadians. By opperating remotely, *VersaBank* is able to minimize costs while focusing on developing and maintaining technologies that provide Canadians with readiy-availible service and options that work for each company. This has driven *VersaBank* to success, allowing impresive results such as their asset-to-employee ratio, which is roughly four times higher than the traditional bank average. Additionally, *VersaBank’s* risk management group strives to ensure that their continued growth does not translate into risk. *VersaBank* and their team are centered around providing the best possible solutions for Canadian banking’s two main services – deposits an finacing. *VersaBank* has become a company dedicated to serving and finacing well-established cooperations and public sector entities. Specifically, their experienced team of lenders focuses of both: Point of Sales Finacing and Project Financing. A large focus of *VersaBank* has been dedicated to the real estate and development industry, and commerical, cooperate, and government projects Canada wide. From 2017 to 2021, VersaBank has served many Canadian companies and reported increased sales year over year. Over the last year, from 2020 to 2021, *VersaBank* recorded a 20.62% [sales growth](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.versabank.9e0aee52c866f6417b7df9aed64c7881.html), displaying their increasing market presence in this sector. To reiterate, majority of the growth and success seen by *VersaBank* is driven by their competitive advantage of being a branchless bank. Their remote stucture allows the company to opperate with minimal costs as they do not need local branches to serve their community. Additionally, operating remotely means that every canadian company is a potentail customer, rather than being restricted to those companies that otherwise would have to be in range of a physical branch. Another advantage of their low-cost remote system is experienced through their comparitively attractive depositor rates and more competitive loans and leases pricing. Perhaps the main driving factor of *VersaBank’s* success involves the technologies the company uses. Through the technology that *VersaBank* leverages, it is able to process large quantities of small-ticket requests and recivables. *VersaBank’s* digital network of partners is extensive, and allows them to source deposits, loans and leases electronically. In late 2016, *VersaBank* also implemented their *Bulk Purchase Program* which to date has exceeded $750 million in outstanding balences of loans and leases.
