## Overview and Origin of VersaBank 
*VersaBank* is a Canadian-founded Schedule 1 chartered bank with a main focus on being a 'branchless' commercial bank which incorporates new and emerging financial technologies. *VersaBank* describes themselves as 'the bank of the future' where customers experience efficiency, reduced costs, and increased choice through their virtual banking experience. During the early 1990s, David Tyler the founder and current president of *VersaBank* began bringing his 'branchless banking' idea to life when he purchased *Pacific & Western Trust* in 1993.  *Pacific & Western Trust* was a previously established bank that was founded on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1979 in Saskatoon, SK and was granted license to operate later that year on October 12<sup>th</sup>, 1979. During this time in the early 1990s, Tyler recognized the potential emerging trends and technologies that could address needs previously unmet in the Canadian financial sector. During 2002, with the incorporation of a well-established Schedule 1 bank, VersaBank was 1 of only 9 Canadian banks with a Schedule 1 Bank license. From here on, *VersaBank* narrowed its focus on becoming an innovative ‘branchless financial institution’ which could focus on meeting the needs of previously ignored or misunderstood niche markets with remote inexpensive yet powerful solutions. Tyler explains on *VersaBank’s* website his initial idea for the company, which focused on two core aspects of banking, the deposit business and the lending business. Over the years, *VersaBank’s* deposit business has seen tremendous growth and has become the most used solution in the Canadian market. *VersaBank’s* lending business has also seen much growth with a focus on developing affordable capital access for both point-of-sale loans and lease partners. Over the last few years the company has expanded its vision into a new area to yet again solve customer needs, this time in the digital assets industry. With the recent launch of *VersaVault*, customers can now easily and securely access storage of their digital assets in a digital equivalent of a safety deposit box. In late 2021, *VersaBank* became a publicly-traded company trading under the ticker [NASDAQ:VBNK](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vbnk/real-time). The IPO raised CA $66 M when it opened with IPO share prices of CA $12.00 on September 24<sup>th</sup>,2021.  

## Business Activities 
As a remote Canadian Bank, *VersaBank* strives to provide increased efficiency and choice to Canadians. By operating remotely, *VersaBank* is able to minimize costs while focusing on developing and maintaining technologies that provide Canadians with readily-available service and options that work for each company. This has driven *VersaBank* to success, allowing impressive results such as their asset-to-employee ratio, which is roughly four times higher than the traditional bank average. Additionally, *VersaBank’s* risk management group strives to ensure that their continued growth does not translate into risk. *VersaBank* and their team are centered around providing the best possible solutions for Canadian banking’s two main services – deposits and financing. *VersaBank* has become a company dedicated to serving and financing well-established corporations and public-sector entities. Specifically, their experienced team of lenders focuses of both: Point of Sales Financing and Project Financing. A large focus of *VersaBank* has been dedicated to the real estate and development industry, and commercial, cooperate, and government projects Canada wide. From 2017 to 2021, *VersaBank* has served many Canadian companies and reported increased sales year over year. Over the last year, from 2020 to 2021, *VersaBank* recorded a 20.62% [sales growth](https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.versabank.9e0aee52c866f6417b7df9aed64c7881.html), displaying their increasing market presence in this sector. To reiterate, majority of the growth and success seen by *VersaBank* is driven by their competitive advantage of being a branchless bank. Their remote structure allows the company to operate with minimal costs as they do not need local branches to serve their community. Additionally, operating remotely means that every Canadian company is a potential customer, rather than being restricted to those companies that otherwise would have to be in range of a physical branch. Another advantage of their low-cost remote system is experienced through their comparatively attractive depositor rates and more competitive loans and leases pricing. Perhaps the main driving factor of *VersaBank’s* success involves the technologies the company uses. Through the technology that *VersaBank* leverages, it is able to process large quantities of small-ticket requests and receivables. *VersaBank’s* digital network of partners is extensive, and allows them to source deposits, loans and leases electronically. In late 2016, *VersaBank* also implemented their *Bulk Purchase Program* which to date has exceeded $750 million in outstanding balances of loans and leases.

## Landscape 
*VersaBank* is a unique Canadian FinTech company that consists in many sectors of financial technology. Primarily, the main domains for *VersaBank* are Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking and Lending although there is some spill over into other domains such as Payments/Billing, Investment Management, Mortgage/Real Estate, and Cryptocurrencies/Digital Assets. In terms of *VersaBank’s* largest domain, Finance/Deposits/Online Banking, the field has seen rapid changes and evolvement over the past decade. Many of the advancements all pertain to increasing banking accessibility and convenience for the customer. This has caused rise in the amount of digital access that companies in this space provide their customers. This trend can be seen through every major Canadian bank having websites and mobile apps that customers can use to view and interact with their financials. Another trend in this field is the increased automation available to users. The increased automation allows for users to automate tasks such as auto payments or auto investments/transfers. Another trend in this field revolves around real-time payments. Due to advances the last few years, today we live in a financial world where payments (mostly e-transfers) can be made any time any day of the year. Yet another advancement in this field consists of the increased amount of personalization available to the user. These changes are displayed in a variety of ways including digital insights into their financial dashboard, payments, balances, and trends. There have also been many personalization advancements in money management resources and investment resources. Similarly, the lending industry has seen many innovations over the last decade, many of which have led to the increase in the digitization of the lending process. Digitization of the lending process results in a variety of benefits for both the company and the customer due to the increased data and predictive models. These technologies allow for better financial decisions, an improved customer experience, and notable cost savings.

Due to the success *VersaBank* has seen in the digital banking and lending industry, it comes as no surprise that other companies would try and adapt some of their technologies and models to lower their competitive advantage. outside of competition from the other Canadian Schedule 1 chartered banks, *VersaBank’s* largest competitors consist of private equity and venture capital companies. Of these firms, *VersaBank’s* largest competitors are *Apax Partners LLP*, *CVC Capital Partners*, *Blackstone Financial Services*, and *Vista Equity Partners*. 

## Results
*VersaBank’s* largest impact thus far has come from their loan portfolio, which in early 2021 surpassed a new record, exceeding over $1.7 billion dollars. This recent impact has been largely driven by their main lending channels, Point-of-Sale Financing and Commercial Banking, which has primarily focused on lending to residential multi-unit builders/developers. In addition, the company is expanding their impact through a third lending channel, Instant Mortgage, an emerging technology enabling high-volume residential financing. The technology places specific focus on allowing individuals with significant wealth the ability to purchase Canadian homes and condos despite having no Canadian credit history. When it comes to measuring *VersaBank’s* success, the core metrics used are [financial results](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/versabank-reports-continued-strong-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-year-end-2021-highlighted-by-record-net-income-for-each-period-and-a-record-loan-portfolio-880908601.html) (such as total revenue, cost of funds, and net income) and [balance sheet and capital ratios](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/versabank-reports-continued-strong-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-year-end-2021-highlighted-by-record-net-income-for-each-period-and-a-record-loan-portfolio-880908601.html) (such as total assets, total capital ratio, and leverage ratio). *VersaBank* finished 2021 strong displaying strong and growing Q4 financials. They finished 2021 with a total revenue of CA $18.24 million (up 16% from Q3), and a net income of CA $5.9 million (up 9% from Q3). They also finished 2021 with CA $2.42 billion worth of total assets (up 6% from Q3) and a total capital ratio of 20.80% (up 16% from Q3). Although *VersaBank* is a growing force in the Canadian financial district, they still are smaller than some of their top competitors such as *Vista Equity Partners* or *CVC Capital Partners*. For example, *Vista Equity Partners* has US $86 billion worth of total assets and works with over 70 companies in over 175 countries. another competitor, *CVC Capital Partners* had a 2021 total income of $80.5 million (221.5% year change) and a net income of $28.01 million.

## Recommendations 
As *VersaBank* continues to grow, I would advise them to continue to focusing on growing their individual finacial options concerning cryptocurrenices and digital assests as well as their growing their team dedicated to residentail housing developments. Canada, but specifically Ontario, is limited when it comes to what crypto trading and assest management platforms are availble to Ontarians. Continuing to grow their ‘digital saftey deposit boxes’ would allow more canadians security and lowered risk when emerging in the crypto enviroment. As well, if they contiuned to expand their stablecoin options availble, they could provide Canadians with increased investment opportunities while maintaining the safety and stability of a traditional banking/investing system. I think that offering an expansion of these services would continue to grow the bank’s customer base while capturing some of the personal investment market they previously are scarce in. These technologies would expand on the same technologies the company has already developed, while offering more utility to the user through increased selection and diversity. These technologies would be approperiate because *VersaBank* has already developed the underlying technologies and securities and would only increase utility to their users.

Another focus I think *VersaBank* should explore involves merging their CryptoVault with their loan/investing buisnesses. I think they should explore the idea of allowing members holding digital assets in their CryptoVault to loan these assets to devlopers in need of capital. In this case *VersaBank* would act as an intermediary linking those in need of captial with those who would be willing to loan through using their digital holdings. In this case *VersaBank* has the potentail of attracting new crypto users to their bank through their loan opportunities availible. This would intice crypto holders to use their bank due to the lending opportunities availible to them. It would also intice those looking for capital loans as it would provide another option for them to explore. Finally, it would benefit *VersaBank* as they would collect a percentage of these transactions which would have otherwise not been done through their platform.
