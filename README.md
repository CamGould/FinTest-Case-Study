## Overview and Origin of VersaBank 
*VersaBank* is a Canadian-founded Scheduale 1 chartered bank with a main focus on being a 'branchless' commercial bank which incorperates new and emerging finacial technologies. *VersaBank* describes themselves as 'the bank of the future' where customers experience efficiency, reduced costs, and increased choice through thier virtual banking experience. During the early 1990s, David Tyler the founder and current president of *VersaBank* began bringing his 'branchless banking' idea to life when he purchased *Pacific & Western Trust* in 1993.  *Pacific & Western Trust* was a previously established bank that was founded on January 1<sup>st</sup>, 1979 in Saskatoon, SK and was granted licence to operate later that year on October 12<sup>th</sup>, 1979. During this time in the early 1990s, Tyler recognized the potenial emerging trends and technologies that could address needs previously unmet in the Canadian finacial sector. During 2002, with the incorperation of a well-established Scheduale 1 bank, VersaBank was 1 of only 9 Canadian banks with a Scheduale 1 Bank licence. From here on, *VersaBank* narrowed its focus on becoming an innovative ‘branchless finacial institution’ which could focus on meeting the needs of previouly ignored or misunderstood niche markets with remote inexpesive yet powerful solutions. Tyler explains on *VersaBank’s* website his intial idea for the company, which focused on two core aspects of banking, the deposit buisness and the lending buisness. Over the years, *VersaBank’s* deposit buisness has seen tremendous growth and has become the most used solution in the Canadian market. *VersaBank’s* lending buisness has also seen much growth with a focus on developing affordable capital access for both point-of-sale loans and lease partners. Over the last few years the company has expanded its vision into a new area to yet again solve customer needs, this time in the digital assets industry. With the recent launch of *VersaVault*, customers can now easily and securly access storage of their digital assets in a digital equivalient of a safety deposit box. In late 2021, *VersaBank* became a publicly-traded company trading under the ticker [NASDAQ:VBNK](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/vbnk/real-time). The IPO raised CA $66 M when it opened with IPO share prices of CA $12.00 on September 24<sup>th</sup>,2021.
